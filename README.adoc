== Introduction

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) allows organizations to rapidly deploy OpenShift to Cloud and On-Premise locations as well as manage the Kubernetes fleet of clusters.


The following diagram provides a high-level overview of a RHACM deployment:


.Advanced Cluster Management Architecture

// This is the https://github.com/redhataccess/documentation-svg-assets/blob/master/for-web/RHACM/186_RHACM/186_RHACM_misc._1221_multicluster-arc.png[source] of the diagram.



When you install RHACM, the operator creates the following namespaces in the *hub cluster*:

* `open-cluster-management`: the deployments for the main features of RHACM.
* `open-cluster-management-hub`: the deployments that receive data from the managed clusters.
* `open-cluster-management-observability``: the RHACM observability engine (Disabled by default).

When you install RHACM, the operator creates the following namespaces in the *managed clusters*:

* `open-cluster-management-agent``: the deployments for the `klusterlet` agent.
* `open-cluster-management-agent-addon``: the application's deployments, search engine, and policies engines.
* `open-cluster-management-agent-addon-observability``: the observability engine's deployments.




== Installing: Automated

Are you in a hurry? Do you need a one-click script? Okay, I understand! Execute the following command:

[source, bash]
----
./auto-install.sh
----


== Installing: Manual

The process of installation is not that complex, but it can be divided into two steps. First, create the namespace for ACM and install the operator. Second, create the `MultiClusterHub` to actually install ACM components.

=== Step 1: The ACM operator

[source, bash]
----
oc process -f openshift/00-operator.yaml | oc apply -f -
----


=== Step 2: The ACM Hub cluster

[source, bash]
----
oc process -f openshift/10-multi-cluster-hub.yaml | oc apply -f -
----





== Observability


You can use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes to gain insight and optimize your managed clusters.

NOTE: Due to the requirement for persistent storage, the observability service is not enabled by default. You must configure an object store to create a storage solution. 


[source, bash]
----
oc process -f openshift/11-multi-cluster-observability.yaml \
    --param-file ./aws-env-vars --ignore-unknown-parameters=true \
    -p DOCKER_CONFIG_JSON="$(oc extract secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --to=-)" | oc apply -f -
----

== Cluster lifecycle with multicluster engine operator


The multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator is the cluster lifecycle operator that provides cluster management capabilities for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management hub clusters.

You can import new clusters from the web console or by using the command line. 


=== Importing Clusters: Web Console

You can import existing clusters from the console for each of the available cloud providers. By default, the namespace is used for the cluster name and namespace, but you can change it.


NOTE: Access the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.8/html-single/clusters/index#importing-managed-cluster-console[official documentation] on how to follow the steps on the Web Console.



=== Importing Clusters: CLI

After you install multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator, you are ready to import a cluster and manage it. The following template defines all the objects that you need to create to import your existing cluster.


NOTE: Before trying to update all the values, I recommend you to check the official documentation, which will save you some time: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.8/html-single/clusters/index#importing-managed-cluster-cli

[source, bash]
----
oc process -f openshift/20-managed-cluster.yaml \
    -p MANAGED_TOKEN="" \
    -p MANAGED_API="" | oc apply -f -
----

Example values are:

* Token: `sha256~Ds0o74XOm54aIMdVaceIHj-afmwiofam`.
* API URL: `https://api.cluster-XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.com:6443`.






== Policies (Governance)

The policy framework provides governance capabilities to ACM-managed Kubernetes clusters. Policies provide visibility and drive remediation for various security and configuration aspects to help IT administrators meet their requirements.

Every policy requires the `policy-template`, `PlacmentRule`, and `PlacementBinding` templates. A policy can have one or more *policy-templates*, but a minimum of one policy-template is needed. The *PlacementRule* template specifies one cluster or set of groups for deploying the policy. As the name implies, the *PlacementBinding* template binds the policy to the PlacementRules.





TIP: For a nice community catalog of Policies, you can check the https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/policy-collection/blob/main/community/README.md[upstream documentation].



=== Policy Controllers

The policy controllers monitor whether your cluster is compliant with a policy. The policy controller also reports the policy status, which you can see on the RHACM governance dashboard.

* *Kubernetes Configuration Policy Controller*: This policy controller manages, configures, and monitors Kubernetes resources.
* *Certificate Policy Controller*: The certificate policy detects when a certificate is about to expire in the default namespace.
* *IAM Policy Controller*: This policy controller sends notifications about IAM policy violations. The IAM policy checks for the number of users with cluster role bindings for the cluster-admin role.
* *Integrating Third-party Policy Controllers*: RHACM governance supports third-party policy controllers such as gatekeeper policy controllers.
* *Custom Policy Controller*: You can create a custom policy controller with the help of a governance-policy-framework repository.




=== Integration I: The OpenShift Compliance Operator

The compliance operator is an OpenShift operator that employs OpenSCAP and enables an administrator to run compliance scans and provide remediation for the issues found. 


=== Integration II: OPA Gatekeeper

ACM provides a built-in policy to deploy the OPA gatekeeper operator. This way, ACM can use OPA gatekeeper as a policy controller and you can use constraints and constraint templates to define admission and audit templates for multiple clusters.















== ArgoCD ApplicationSets with ACM


`ApplicationSet` is a sub-project of Argo CD that is supported by the GitOps Operator. ApplicationSet adds multicluster support for Argo CD applications. You can create an application set from the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management console.

NOTE: If you are going to configure this setup, I recommend you to read carefully the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.8/html-single/applications/index#gitops-config[documentation] in sections 1.6.8, 1.6.9, and 1.6.10.


First, you need to make sure that you have Openshift Gitops up and running. I recommend you to check out this other repository where I configure ArgoCD in the way that the following scripts will expect it:

* Clone the https://github.com/alvarolop/ocp-gitops-playground[OCP GitOps Playground] repository.
* Execute the steps detailed in the README.adoc.

The following template configures a `Placement` rule that handles all the OpenShift clusters and adds them to the ArgoCD instance:

[source, bash]
----
oc process -f openshift/30-gitops-integration.yaml | oc apply -f -
----


=== The Push and Pull model

Using a *Push model*, The Argo CD server on the hub cluster deploys the application resources on the managed clusters. For the *Pull model*, the application resources are propagated by the Propagation controller to the managed clusters by using `manifestWork`.

NOTE: Pull Model is Tech Preview in ACM 2.8, so we will just explore the Push alternative as of today.
